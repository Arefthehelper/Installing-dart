To install Dart on your system, you can follow the steps appropriate to your operating system. Below are the instructions for installing Dart on different platforms:

### 1. **Windows**

#### Option 1: Install via the Dart SDK Installer

1. **Download Dart SDK Installer:**

     - Right-click on "This PC" > "Properties" > "Advanced system settings".
     - Click "Environment Variables".
     - Add the path to the Dart SDK `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\tools\dart-sdk\bin`) to the `PATH` environment variable.

4. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open Command Prompt and run:
     ```bash
     dart --version
     ```
   - This should display the installed Dart version.

#### Option 2: Install via Chocolatey

1. **Install Chocolatey** (if not already installed):

     export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/lib/dart-sdk/bin"
     ```

4. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Run:
     ```bash

     ```

### 3. **Linux (Ubuntu)**

1. **Add the Dart APT repository:**

     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install apt-transport-https
     sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -'
     sudo sh -c 'wget -qO- https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian/dart_stable.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list'

     ```bash
     dart --version
     ```

### 4. **Verify Installation Across All Platforms**

After following the steps for your platform, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
dart --version
```

This command should output the version of Dart installed on your machine, confirming that the installation was successful.

### 5. **Optional: Set Up an IDE**

For development, you can use various IDEs that support Dart, such as:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Install the Dart extension from the marketplace.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Install the Dart plugin.

Your environment is now set up for Dart development!
